<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to run this in you local system.

- Any Server - I personally used `XAMPP`

- Jupyter notebook

To install jupyter notebook, use this command in **cmd**

```sh
pip install notebook
```

and to open it in you the given directory, open that directory in **cmd** and type

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

### Running in localhost

1. After having all the required prerequisites **clone** the repository. If you are using `XAMPP` clone it in `XAMPP/htdocs` folder.

```git
git clone https://github.com/Yashi1011/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition.git
```

2. Start the server and open the `Digit-Recognition/index.html` in localhost.
